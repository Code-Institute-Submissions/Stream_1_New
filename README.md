# Stream 1 - Frontend

This is the final project for Stream 1 with Code Institute, to create a front end website for a band, The Monkees

## Explanation of Project

This was my first endeavour into the world of html, css and AngularJS. The idea was to create a front-end web page with a few pages, with functionality using source material provided to me by Code Institute. Personally, this is quite a basic and simple website. There are many things I would like to improve if I get chance to revisit this maiden project, given how much I have learned and understood since I built this in early 2017.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this locally, you can follow these simple steps;

1. Clone or Pull this Repository
2. Install npm. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Install dependencies in package.json
4. Install http-server `npm install -g http-server`
5. Run http-server via cmd
6. This project is now live on Localhost. Visit in your browser to view.

## Deployment

Alternatively to running this locally, this project is deployed onto [Github Pages](https://ryanware1987.github.io/Stream_1_New/app/index.html)


## Built With

- AngularJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Sublime Text as preferred IDE


## Testing

Manual Testing was used throughout this project, to check if AngularJS functions worked as well as they were supposed to, and the links redirected the user to where they should be taken to. Content was also tested, such as functionality of the audio files playing and the video playing in the Video page.

### Known Issues After Testing

There remains some issues with functionality around the forms, particularly the Contact Us form & the Subscription form. This would be one area I would like to tackle given some extra time but at this point I have left it on my to-do list for the future.

I would like to incorporate additional validation on these forms, along with custom outputs if the validation were to fail.

The Maps controller and function failed which was in the About.html page. This had worked previously locally, but after the push to Github Pages the feature was not working as expected, so most of the code was removed, and the feature was replaced by an iframe from Google Maps. The Location is supposed to be set to Toronto, Canada.

The Calendar function - has been linked to my own calendar. It could be explored to create a new mock calendar for the purpose of this project if it were to be demonstrated out, but would need maintenance if the calendar was to look populated to the user.

## Acknowledgements

This first project and delve into the world of website building would not have been possible without the help of Code Institute and mentor's Yoni Lavi & Jessamyn Smith.
